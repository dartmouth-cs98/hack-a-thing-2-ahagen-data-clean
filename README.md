### Short description of what you attempted to build
I wanted to learn how to clean complex data sets with the Pandas and Numpy python libraries and begin to understand how they can be used for machine learning. 
I used a few tutorials and read a lot online about what's important to know about web scraping and data cleaning. 
I also thought it would be cool to analyze my own web browser history and found information for how to use sqlite to get the data into a readable file which was cool. This part took me longer than I thought since I also had to figure out how to get rid of some irregularly dated web history in the file. 
I enjoyed also adding a data visualization as a pie graph of my most frequently visited websites.
After finishing playing with my web browser history, I used a different tutorial to create a simple ML model on a public data set.
Here are some links I used:

### What you learned
I learned how to use dataframes in pandas, and the helpful functions available through numpy to change and pivot data in arrays.
I also learned how to scrape my web browser history and create a simple machine learning example with sklearn.

### How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
I think it would be really cool to work on a project that is data reliant and I'm glad I became more familier with the tools for data cleaning.
I also think a machine learning model for predicting habits could be really useful and not so difficult after doing the tutorials.

### What didnâ€™t work
A few attempts at getting my browser's web history didn't work at first but I figured it out.
